## Content

The Mobile contains:

- a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) (v**0.61.5**) application (in "[ejected](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/EJECTING.md)" mode to allow using dependencies that rely on native code)
- a [clear directory layout](#directory-layout) to provide a base architecture for your application
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (v4.0.1) to help manage state
- [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) (v5.10.0) to persist the Redux state
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (v3.11.2) with a [`NavigationService`](App/Services/NavigationService.js) to handle routing and navigation in the app, with a splash screen setup by default
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to make API calls (v0.19.0)
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) preconfigured for React Native


## Directory layout

- [`App/Components`](App/Components): presentational components
- [`App/Config`](App/Config): configuration of the application
- [`App/Containers`](App/Containers): container components, i.e. the application's screens
- [`App/Assets`](App/Assets): assets (image, audio files, ...) used by the application
- [`App/Navigators`](App/Navigators): react navigation navigators 
- [`App/Services`](App/Services): application services, e.g. API clients
- [`App/Stores`](App/Stores): redux [actions, reducers and stores](https://redux.js.org/basics)
- [`App/Theme`](App/Theme): base styles for the application



## Requirements

Node 8 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 9 or up, and will target iOS 9 and up.

You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native:

- for [Android development](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-3)
- for [iOS development](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies)

## Running the project

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can setup and run the project by running:

- `yarn install` to install the dependencies
- create your [configuration file `App/Config/index.js`](App/Config) from `index.dev.js` (if you are in dev environment) and fill the missing values
- run the following steps for your platform

### Android

- only the first time you run the project, you need to generate a debug key with:
  - `cd android/app`
  - `keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`
  - `cd ../..` to come back to the root folder
- `yarn start` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal
- `yarn android` to run the Android application (remember to start a simulator or connect an Android phone)
- `npm start` to run the packedger


### iOS

- `cd ios`
- `pod install` to install pod dependencies
- `cd ..` to come back to the root folder
- `yarn start` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal
- `yarn ios` to run the iOS application (remember to start a simulator or connect an iPhone phone)
- `npm start` to run the packedger


## Useful documentation

### Deployment

  - [Distributing beta builds](docs/beta%20builds.md)

### Package dependencies

- You may want to use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) to manage your dependencies (iOS only)
